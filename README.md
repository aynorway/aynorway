Hello everyone, I'm Adrian Y, "老6". This is a powerful browser extension I developed in my spare time. It allows users to freely control the playback speed of almost any online video, with perfect compatibility for YouTube. Not just specific to certain video services, it's suitable for nearly all websites using standard video players, such as Vimeo, Bilibili, Youku, etc. It caters to those who require precise speed adjustments, with an accuracy of 0.01x and up to 16x speed. The extension is compatible with both Chrome and Firefox browsers. It's currently available for free, and I hope it helps you all!

This software does not utilize an open source license; click [here](JS_File_Disclosure_Explanation.md) for the rationale.

# [TimeTrackBar Desktop Application (For Both Mac & Windows)](https://github.com/aynorway/ay-timetrackbar-java/tree/master)

---
<img src="pics/ttb/ttb17.png" width="64" align="left" style="margin: 10px; vertical-align: middle;"> TimeTrackBar is a minimalist Java-based timer designed for intuitive time tracking, offering both visual progress and cross-platform support. Packed with features, it aids effective time management and remains open-source.

### For a comprehensive documentation, please refer to: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [☞ English (英文)](https://github.com/aynorway/timetrackbar/blob/master/README.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[☞ Chinese (中文)](https://github.com/aynorway/timetrackbar/blob/master/README_cn.md)

Hello everyone, I'm Adrain Y, also known as "老6". This time-tracking software is one of my personal favorite software projects. I've always been on the lookout for a tool that displays both the time and a progress bar, aiming for a more intuitive feel of the passing time. After not finding a minimalist timer that met my requirements for quite some time, I decided to create one myself. Currently, I use this software almost daily to track my work hours, which greatly assists me in understanding and allocating my time more effectively. This project is developed entirely in Java, ensuring easy cross-platform compilation. Versions for both MacBook and Windows have been released. To guarantee the software's compatibility, I've intentionally employed the foundational Unicode character set. In the upcoming versions, I plan to introduce several new features, including report generation, data analysis, and an always-on-top window feature. Moreover, the ability to continue monitoring time even when the computer is in sleep mode is under development. I invite everyone who values their time to give it a try. This software will remain open-source indefinitely, hoping to benefit many.

## Features

- Extremely user-friendly logic.
- Automatic time calculation with progress display.
- Clear progress bar interface.
- Ability to add/delete multiple timing tasks.
- Start/pause timer functionality.
- Sound alert/mute feature.
- Auto detection of stopwatch/countdown mode.
- "Always On Top" mode for keeping the application window in the foreground.

## User Interface Guide

![Alt text](pics/ttb/Interface.png)
From left to right:

- **"+" Button**: Add a new timing task.
- **"-" Button**: Delete a specific timing task.
- **Text Input Box**: Supports up to 7 characters, suitable for brief notes or memos.
- **Progress Bar**: Displays the timing progress.
- **⏲ Icon Button**: Click to expand or hide the time setting panel.
- **Sound Toggle Button**: Default is a musical note (♫). Clicking it changes to a crescent moon (☽) indicating mute. Through this button, you can decide whether to sound an alert when the timer ends.
- **Remaining Time Display**: Shows the remaining time for the timer or countdown.
- **▶ Button**: Start or pause the timer. Blue in stopwatch mode and magenta in countdown mode.
- **⏹ Button**: Stop and reset the timer completely.
